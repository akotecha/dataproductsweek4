# Data Products Week 4 Assignment


## Objective

The project involves two main parts:

1. Write a shiny application with associated documentation and deploy the application on Shiny's server.
2. Develop a presentation to pitch the app using RStudio Presenter. 



## Shiny App description

This app uses a linear model built off R's mtcars dataset to predict the efficiency of a car (measured by predicted miles per gallon (mpg))
The model predicts mpg using 3 variables: the car weight, quarter mile time and transmission type

The app allows the user to toggle between these 3 variables. The output of the app (predicted mpg) will be shown to the right of the input sliders.
